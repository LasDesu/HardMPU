HardMPU: An intelligent MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface based on an Atmega microcontroller and SoftMPU software.

Features:
- IRQ driven intelligent mode compatible
- UART mode compatible
- SysEx delay for Roland MT-32 on faster computers
- "Fake all notes off" for Roland RA-50
- JTAG, ISP, and UART interfaces for user expansion

Limitations:
- Playback only, recording planned but not yet implemented
- Requires an ISA slot in your computer
- SysEx and fake all notes off features implemented, but currently have to be enabled or disables in the source code.
  Software on/off for these features is next on the list to be implemented.
